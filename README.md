# QPair - iOS Bluetooth LE Pairing App Demo

## Overview

QPair is an iOS application developed in Swift, designed to demonstrate the pairing workflow for COSMED Q Bluetooth LE peripherals.
The necessity came up because, while Windows and Android provide a programmatic way to initiate pairing with the desired security level (without going into Settings), iOS handles this differently.
The CoreBluetooth framework does not have the ability to initiate pairingâ€”this process is managed exclusively by iOS.  
A programmatic way to force iOS to start pairing is to connect to the device and attempt to access an encrypted characteristic.  
Therefore, in Q firmware version **1.0-rc15**, I have encrypted the following characteristics of the **CSS service** (UUID: `b381fcca-142a-4b9b-ba1f-af6a3ea715c7`):  

- **CSS Spirometer Measurement Characteristic Value** (`b3810001-142a-4b9b-ba1f-af6a3ea715c7`)  
- **CSS Environment Measurement Characteristic Value** (`b3810002-142a-4b9b-ba1f-af6a3ea715c7`) 

## Key Features

*   **Targeted Peripheral Discovery:** QPair performs targeted scanning, filtering for Bluetooth LE peripherals that match the regular expression pattern `^Q \\d{10}$` in their advertised name. This pattern matches peripheral names that start with "Q" followed by a space and then 10 digits.
*   **Automatic Pairing:** Upon establishing a connection, QPair automatically initiates the iOS pairing process by leveraging the `CBPeripheral.setNotifyValue(true, for:)` method on a protected GATT characteristic. This eliminates the need for manual pairing steps.
*   **Connection Management:** The app manages connection and disconnection events through the `CBCentralManagerDelegate` and `CBPeripheralDelegate` protocols.
*   **Protected Characteristic Access:** The app interacts with a specific, protected GATT characteristic (UUID: `b3810002-142a-4b9b-ba1f-af6a3ea715c7` within service `b381fcca-142a-4b9b-ba1f-af6a3ea715c7`) to trigger the pairing process.
*   **SwiftUI User Interface:** The user interface is built using SwiftUI, providing a reactive and declarative approach to UI updates.
* **Automatic Scan:** The app automatically starts scanning when it launches and when a peripheral is disconnected or the connection fails.
* **Stop Scan on Connect:** The app automatically stops scanning when a connection is established.
* **Connection State:** The app visually indicates the connection state of each peripheral in the list.
